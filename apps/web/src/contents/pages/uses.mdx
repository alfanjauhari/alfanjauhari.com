## Desk Setup

- I use a PC with Windows 11 and Ubuntu as my main operating system. Usually I use Windows for gaming/college stuff and Ubuntu for my works. My PC specs are listed below:
  - **CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5500**
  - **GPU: AMD Radeon RX 6600**
  - **RAM: Corsair Vengeance 32GB**
  - **Storage: Klevv SSD Cras C710 NVMe 500GB (Windows)** + **Teamgroup SSD SATA CX2 512GB (Ubuntu)** + **Samsung EVO 870 1TB (Storage)**
  - **PSU: NZXT C550 Bronze 550W**
  - **Case: Cube Gaming Lich Black**
  - **CPU Cooler: ID-COOLING SE-214-XT**
  - **Motherboard: ASUS TUF Gaming B450M-Pro II** (kinda regret buying this one)

- I have **MacBook Air M1 2020** as my secondary laptop. I use it if I need to work outside.
- I have **Keychron K3** as my main keyboard and **Logitech Superlight** as my main mouse (so good for competitive gaming).

## Software

- **Visual Studio Code** is my main code editor. I use it mostly for web development and sometimes write markdown articles.
  - In VSCode, I use **SF Mono** as my font and **Catppuccin** as my theme.
  - I don't have many extensions, so far I just use essentials extensions for web development, like formatter, linter, etc.
- I use **Firefox** for browsing and web development because it's more feature-rich than Chrome (i guess).
- Currently I love using **Alacritty** as my terminal emulator. It's fast and customizable.
  - Inside Alacritty, I use **Zsh** as my shell and **Oh My Zsh** as my Zsh framework.
  - Sometimes for light task, I use **NeoVim** as my text editor.
- In my MacBook Air M1, I have same software setup as my PC, with some additional software like **Raycast** for easily access my tools.

## Tech Stack

- I use **React** as my main frontend library. I love how it's easy to use and have a lot of community support.
  - **NextJS** is my go-to framework for building React apps. It's easy to use and have a lot of features (even it can be suck sometimes).
  - For state management, query fetching or table component, I use library from **TanStack**.
- For styling, most of the time I use **TailwindCSS**, but I know how CSS works xD.
- All of my JavaScript projects always using **TypeScript**. To keep my code clean and easy to read.
- For backend, sometimes I use **Fastify** or fullstack **NextJS** but at my office we heavily use **Golang** for our backend.
- All of my projects that need database alway use **PostgreSQL**. I love how it's easy to use and have a lot of features.
- For deployment, I use different approach based on my project requirements but for my personal projects, I use **Vercel** for frontend and **Fly.io** for backend.
  - Most of my projects are using **Docker** for containerization.
  - For CI/CD, I use **GitHub Actions** for my personal projects and **GitLab CI/CD** for my office projects.
  - I use **Sentry** as my go-to error tracking tool. Sometimes in my office we use **Glitchtip** for our projects.
  - I use **Cloudflare** for my DNS management and sometimes **Cloudflare Workers** for my serverless functions.
  - For monitoring, I use **Grafana** and sometimes **Prometheus** for my office projects.
  - *For disclaimer, I'm not an expert in DevOps, I just know how to use it.*
- In the free time, I learn mobile development with **Kotlin Multiplatform**
