Hi! I'm Alfan Jauhari, you can just call me Alfan. I'm currently working as a Product Engineer at [Zero One Group](https://zero-one-group.com), where I build and improve web applications that solve real-world problems.

I've been in the web development for over 4 years now, with a strong focus on frontend engineering using React.js and TypeScript as my main language, and I enjoy diving deep into the ecosystem not just to build things, but to understand how things work under the hood. (_You can learn more about my tech stack on [this page](/uses)_)

I'm especially interested in improving developer experience, so I love tinkering with tooling, setting up design systems, and creating reusable components that make life easier for me and my teams.

When I have time, I like reading through open-source repositories, especially large React + TypeScript codebases. You'd be surprised how many interesting patterns and tricks you can find that aren't even documented! Lately, I've been taking small steps to contribute back to the tools I rely on every day, one of them is Better Auth, a project I really enjoy learning from.

Outside of coding, I sometimes write blog posts about programming, tech, or just random thoughts, it helps me reflect and learn even more.
