import { ProgressiveForm } from "./_components/progressive-form";

Have you ever opened some website but it doesn’t work on your ancient devices? It’s kinda stressful isn’t it when you try surfing on the internet you need to spend your money to buy a new device first. Well, if you feel that way, when building a website you need to pay attention to backward compatibility so more users can use your websites smoothly without a problem. And that's where you need progressive enhancement when building websites for more accessibility and backward compatibility.

## Progressive Enhancement

Quoted from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) :

> Progressive enhancement is a design philosophy that provides a baseline of essential content and functionality to as many users as possible, while delivering the best possible experience only to users of the most modern browsers that can run all the required code.

This means with progressive enhancement we can improve user experience regardless of their user agent. So, although the user opens it from IE 1 it can still be working fine (but what kind of psycho is using IE in this economy?) with some features reduced probably, but hey it works!
