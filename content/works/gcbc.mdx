challenge: Building the GCBC platform meant handling a few core hurdles. The site needed reliable multilingual support to reach EMDE audiences globally, strong SEO performance to surface climate-finance resources effectively, and robust SSR to ensure fast, consistent delivery for a content-heavy platform. Managing all of this while keeping the experience smooth and scalable added an extra layer of complexity.
solution: I implemented multilingual routing through the Next.js Page Router to keep translations clean, predictable, and easy to extend. For SEO, I followed Google’s best practices plus a mix of vetted third-party guidelines to structure metadata, indexing, and semantic content. And for SSR, I fully leveraged Next.js’ server-side rendering to deliver faster initial load times, stable performance across regions, and a better foundation for dynamic content.

## About Global Capacity Building Coalition

The Global Capacity Building Coalition (GCBC) is a global initiative formed to accelerate sustainable finance by strengthening the capabilities of financial institutions and professionals especially in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). Launched at COP28, the coalition brings together many of the world’s leading climate-finance organizations to mobilize the capital required for the transition to clean, resilient economies.

Built on the belief that capacity building is a catalyst not an end in itself GCBC exists to close the knowledge, resource, and skills gap that currently limits climate investment. Through coordinated global, regional, and national efforts, the coalition convenes financial institutions, regulators, multilateral organizations, training bodies, NGOs, and academic institutions to streamline learning, clarify incentives, and support the development of effective climate-finance practices. By unifying this ecosystem, GCBC helps unlock capital flows, improve investor confidence, and accelerate sustainable development outcomes.

The coalition’s digital platform, capacity-building.org, functions as a central hub where users can access high-quality educational resources, case studies, live learning events, and interactive tools. Designed to simplify a previously fragmented landscape, the platform expands reach through translation features, enhances usability through optimized search, and continuously improves through user feedback. Its goal is to make climate-finance knowledge accessible, actionable, and scalable for institutions of all sizes across the world.

GCBC is chaired by Mary L. Schapiro former SEC Chair, Chair of the Climate Data Steering Committee, and Vice Chair of GFANZ reflecting the coalition’s commitment to global leadership and high standards of governance. Its members include an unprecedented alliance of UN agencies, multilateral development banks, development finance institutions, philanthropic organizations, and other capacity-building leaders working collectively with thousands of financial institutions, financial centres, and professionals worldwide.
