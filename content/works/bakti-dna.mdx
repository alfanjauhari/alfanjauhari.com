title: BAKTI DNA
summary: A national-scale telecommunications infrastructure platform delivering connectivity to remote regions through satellite services, internet access points, backbone networks, mobile base stations, and digital-ecosystem enablement programs across priority sectors.
client: Kemenkominfo
role: Product Engineer II
year: 2022
techstack: [TypeScript, NextJS (13), NX, Chakra UI]

challenge: The client needed a unified platform capable of managing thousands of satellite links, internet access points, backbone nodes, and BTS assets distributed across remote regions. Existing systems were fragmented, relied heavily on manual data reconciliation, and struggled to deliver accurate operational visibility especially for infrastructure in hard-to-reach WPUTI areas.
solution: We designed and implemented an integrated infrastructure management system with automated data ingestion pipelines, geospatial mapping, and real-time status monitoring. The platform consolidates satellite, fiber, and BTS data sources into a single operational dashboard, enabling proactive issue detection and streamlined field coordination. By optimizing API communication, caching, and background sync processes, the system ensures reliable performance even with intermittent connectivity typical of remote deployments.
