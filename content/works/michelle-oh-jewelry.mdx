client: Michelle Oh
role: Product Engineer II

challenge: The client needed a flexible e-commerce platform built on Shopify that could support a highly bespoke jewellery brand while still being scalable and easy to manage. Default Shopify themes were too rigid to accommodate custom product configurations, rich storytelling, and brand-driven layouts. On the operational side, managing product data, collections, and content updates became inefficient due to limited control over presentation and dynamic logic using out-of-the-box tools.
solution: I developed a custom Shopify storefront using Liquid, enabling fully tailored templates, reusable components, and dynamic sections aligned with the brand’s visual identity. Custom product logic, metafields, and modular content blocks were implemented to support complex jewellery details and flexible merchandising. By optimizing Liquid rendering, leveraging Shopify’s native APIs, and structuring clean, maintainable theme architecture, the solution delivers a performant, scalable storefront that empowers the client to manage content efficiently without sacrificing design or user experience.
