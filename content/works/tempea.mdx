title: Tempea
summary: A craft-forward food brand web project built to showcase Tempea’s journey from a BCIT Food Tech lab to a real sustainable plant-based product, telling a story of flavour, community, and conscious eating. Built as a dynamic, clean, and engaging WordPress site using Elementor and custom PHP enhancements.
client: Tempea
role: Product Engineer III
year: 2024
techstack: [Wordpress, Elementor, PHP]
challenge: The client needed a storytelling first brand site that clearly communicated Tempea’s origins, values, and product ethos. Since the project was built on WordPress with Elementor, the main challenge was handling dynamic, structured content especially the product page and modular blocks without forcing rigid template constraints. Default Elementor setups made it hard to consistently manage dynamic content, custom fields, and content relationships across pages, leading to inefficiencies and maintenance friction.
solution: I designed the site architecture around custom WordPress templates and tailored Elementor integrations, giving content editors full control without breaking structure. I built reusable, dynamic blocks that pull from custom fields, combined with selective PHP overrides where needed to extend Elementor’s logic. The result is a flexible, maintainable WordPress/Elementor build that supports rich storytelling and modular content workflows, empowering the client to update narrative elements and product info cleanly and efficiently while keeping performance and UX solid.
